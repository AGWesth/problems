# Absolute Values

## Solve for x over the real numbers: $| \frac{9x}{10} + \frac{15}{16} |  = \frac{2}{3}$

**Eliminate the absolute value.**

Split the equation into two possible cases:  
$$\frac{9x}{10} + \frac{15}{16} = \frac{2}{3}$$  
or  
$$\frac{9x}{10} + \frac{15}{16} = -\frac{2}{3}$$  

**Look at the first equation: Isolate terms with x to the left-hand side.**

Subtract $\frac{15}{16}$ from both sides:  
$$\frac{9x}{10} = \frac{2}{3} - \frac{15}{16}$$  

**Solve for x.**

Multiply both sides by $\frac{10}{9}$:  
$$x = \frac{-65}{216}$$  

**Look at the second equation: Isolate terms with x to the left-hand side.**

Subtract $\frac{15}{16}$ from both sides:  
$$\frac{9x}{10} = -\frac{2}{3} - \frac{15}{16}$$  

**Solve for x.**

Multiply both sides by $\frac{10}{9}$:  
$$x = \frac{-385}{216}$$  

**Answer:**  
$$x = \frac{-65}{216} \text{ or } x = \frac{-385}{216}$$

## Solve for $m$ over the real numbers: $|-23m + 13| = 21$

**Eliminate the absolute value.**

Split the equation into two possible cases:  
$-23m + 13 = 21$ or $-23m + 13 = -21$

**Look at the first equation: Isolate terms with $m$ to the left-hand side.**

Subtract 13 from both sides:  
$-23m = 8$ or $-23m + 13 = -21$

**Solve for $m$.**

Divide both sides by $-23$:  
$m = \frac{-8}{23}$ or $-23m + 13 = -21$

**Look at the second equation: Isolate terms with $m$ to the left-hand side.**

Subtract 13 from both sides:  
$m = \frac{-8}{23}$ or $-23m = -34$

**Solve for $m$.**

Divide both sides by $-23$:  
Answer:  
$m = \frac{-8}{23}$ or $m = \frac{34}{23}$
